Given a group, G, we represent a G-torsor as a tuple,
(X, m, α, λ, ι, τ, ν), where  m : G × X → X is the action, 
and the remaining components represent the associativity
property, the left unit property, the proof that X is a 
set, the proof that G acts freely and transitively on X,
and the proof that X is nonempty.


Note, however, that we've expressed these properties
indirectly, by defining properties that (we claim but
do not yet prove) imply them. Our properties are better
for use in Lean.
