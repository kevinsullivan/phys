Outstanding problems: 
  - render C++ physics to clean physically type-checked expressions in Lean
  - need MVP for "time" as an affine space with arbitrary affine coordinate space overlays
    - need general library supporting (1-D) affine space API, used to implement physical time  
    - need version of Peirce working end-to-end with terms having physical type, time
Progress this week:
  - assessed situation with respect to affine space and time library
  - decided to use what I've learned from working with students to "get it done"
  - goal: clearly implement an "affine algebra of time" as a semantic domain for Peirce
  - approach: 
      - MVP: pick a 1-D problem
      - *Build from the mathematics up* rather than from some front-end preconception down
      - Represent 1-D affine space as 2-D linear space in the usual way
      - Instantiate vector_space typeclass for 2-D linear space (operations and notations)
      - Build 1-D bare (no frames) affine space algebra, instantiating affine_space typeclass
      - Each layer of the design is *cleanly* implemented in terms of immediately preceding layer
      - Build up from here by *extending* low-level abstractions, instantiating affine_space each time
        - vc (linear 2-D K space)
        - pt, vec, fm (affine 1-D K space)
        - point, vectr, frame, coordinate space
        - time, duration, frame, coordinate space
      - provide examples/tests to show the algebra at each level
    - contribution: enable progress in this project
    - next steps: discuss after presentation

Afterthoughts
-/

-- fill in the proofs (low risk, low priority; postpone)
-- get transforms working in this design (design proposal needed)
-- support end-to-end in Peirce (schedule discussion for lang-level design)

-- add helper functions to access coordinates directly
-- get affine combinations working (not high priority)
-- re-imagine a tf-like API based on work in this style
